      I love the voyager twin satellites because they have gone further into
      space then any known man-made object, and they still are able to
      communicate and relay information back to us. They have helped a great
      deal in the understanding of our solarsystem, but they still are going
      farther out into space to give us new and amazing information.

      I love the James Webb Space Telescope(JWST) becase of how much a marval of
      engeneering it is. the amount of thought, effort and people that went into
      creating, designing and building all the componants are insane. the
      satellite has 18 panels that direct infared and radio waves into the
      sesors, the non visable light alowing us to look much further with much
      more clarity then ever before.

      The International Space Station or "ISS" is probably the most famouse
      satellite simply for the reason that we can have people onboard and living
      there for months. The iss is so amazing because it allows us to run tests
      that would be impossible otherwise, due to the zero gravity. My favorite
      this about the iss though, is how it achevies that zero gravity effect.
      It's not because of the fact its in space, but because it is in a constant
      freefall while orbiting the earth.
